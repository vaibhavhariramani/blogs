## What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is like going on an exciting adventure through the world of artificial intelligence. It's a special type of machine learning that draws inspiration from the incredible human brain. Just like our brains have networks of neurons, Deep Learning uses algorithms to create artificial neural networks.

These networks are magical because they can learn and predict things that seem impossible. Imagine a machine that can understand speech, recognize images, and even understand human language. That's what Deep Learning can do!

**In other words, Deep Learning is an approach to learning where we can make a machine imitate the network of neurons in a human brain. It consists of algorithms which allow machines to train to perform tasks like speech, image recognition and Natural Language Processing. It is a statistical approach based on Deep Networks, where we break down a task and distribute into machine learning algorithms.**

These algorithms are constructed with connected layers. In between first layer or input layer and last layer or output layer we have set of hidden layers in between that eventually gave rise to the word Deep which means networks that join neurons in more than two layers. These neurons are connected to one another, which propagates the input signal after it goes through the process. In Deep Learning a network can consume a large amount of input data, then process them through multiple layers because of which we can learn complex features of the data.
Now that we have gathered an idea of what Deep Learning is, letâ€™s see why we need Deep Learning.
