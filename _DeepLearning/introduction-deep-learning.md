## What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning domain. Deep learning is entirely concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of artificial neural networks which are inspired by the human brain (inspired only pls). Deep learning is used with too much ease to predict the unpredictable. In our opinion “We all are so busy in creating artificial intelligence by using a combination of non-bio neural networks and natural intelligence rather than exploring what we have in hand.

**In other words, Deep Learning is an approach to learning where we can make a machine imitate the network of neurons in a human brain. It consists of algorithms which allow machines to train to perform tasks like speech, image recognition and Natural Language Processing. It is a statistical approach based on Deep Networks, where we break down a task and distribute into machine learning algorithms.** 

These algorithms are constructed with connected layers. In between first layer or input layer and last layer or output layer we have set of hidden layers in between that eventually gave rise to the word Deep which means networks that join neurons in more than two layers. These neurons are connected to one another, which propagates the input signal after it goes through the process. In Deep Learning a network can consume a large amount of input data, then process them through multiple layers because of which we can learn complex features of the data.
Now that we have gathered an idea of what Deep Learning is, let’s see why we need Deep Learning.
